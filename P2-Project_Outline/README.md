# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a social app or website that allows users to post, rate and share recipes. This idea was born out of my frustration with with most mainstream cooking sites being a nightmare to navigate; full of advertisements, alerts and needless test bloat between you and the food that you want to make. In addition to the features stated earlier, I plan to implement comments on recipes, the ability to suggest combinations of dishes and user "scores" based on how popular their shared recipes are.

### Features
User login: Users will be able create accounts and login to those accounts. They will have profiles where things like their favorite recipes, comments and ratings will be stored.
Search: Users will be able to search for recipes by different criteria or search for creators.
Post: Users will be able to post their own recipes or their modified versions of existing recipes and tag with them with relevant keywords.
Comment: Users will be able to leave comments and ratings on recipes.

### Technologies
Java
Thymeleaf
Spring Boot
MySQL

### What I'll Have to Learn
I'm still unsure of what new technologies I will need to learn. However there are a number of issues that I know I will need to solve, such as managing user logins, ratings and comments.
